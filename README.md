# 🧭 Path Finding Visualizer

This repository contains implementations of pathfinding algorithms with visualizations using **Pygame**. These visualizations are educational tools designed to show how different algorithms explore a grid to find the shortest path between two points.

Currently, the project includes an implementation of the **A\*** (A-star) algorithm, and is structured to be easily extendable with other pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra’s, BFS, DFS, etc.

## ✨ Features

- Interactive grid creation (add/remove barriers, select start and end points)
- Real-time pathfinding visualization
- Keyboard and mouse control
- Clear and colorful representation of algorithm states

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Application
```bash
python astar.py
```
